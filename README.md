# Mall Customer Segmentation DAO

## Overview

This DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governs the open-source Mall Customer Segmentation project, which applies KMeans clustering to analyze mall customer behavior. By segmenting customers based on annual income and spending score, the project enables data-driven decisions for targeted marketing and customer engagement.

## DAO Mission

Empower businesses and developers to leverage customer segmentation insights for enhanced customer experience, profitability, and open collaboration.

## Scope

- Maintain and improve the KMeans customer segmentation codebase.
- Curate datasets relevant to retail customer analysis.
- Foster community discussion and innovation around customer segmentation.
- Govern project direction, feature proposals, and contributions.

## Dataset

**File:** `Mall_Customers.csv`  
**Columns:**
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier
- `Gender`: Customer gender
- `Age`: Customer age
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousands USD
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Mall-assigned behavior/spending score

_No missing values; 200 entries._

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand dataset structure and content.
2. **Feature Selection**: Use `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)` for clustering.
3. **Optimal Cluster Selection**: Apply the Elbow Method (WCSS) to determine ideal cluster count. Five clusters recommended.
4. **KMeans Clustering**: Segment customers using the KMeans algorithm.
5. **Cluster Profiling**: Analyze average income and spending score per cluster.
6. **Visualization**: Display clusters and centroids (e.g., scatter plots).

## Results

- Customers segmented into **5 clusters** with distinct income and spending profiles.
- Cluster types include: high income-high spending, low income-low spending, etc.
- Visualizations provide clear separation between groups.

## Potential Applications

- **Targeted Marketing**: Design campaigns specific to each segment.
- **Personalized Offers**: Recommend offers/products based on cluster.
- **Store Optimization**: Improve layout/product placement for dominant segments.
- **Relationship Management**: Tailor engagement strategies for each group.

## How to Use

1. Install Python and libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
2. Download `Mall_Customers.csv`.
3. Run the provided notebook/script to perform clustering and view results.

## DAO Governance
